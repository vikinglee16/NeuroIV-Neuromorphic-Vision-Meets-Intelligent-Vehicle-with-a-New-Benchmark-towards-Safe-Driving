# Abstract
Neuromorphic vision sensors such as the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) using silicon retina are inspired by biological vision, \hl{they generate streams of asynchronous events to indicate local log-intensity brightness changes}. Their properties of high temporal resolution, low-bandwidth, lightweight computation, and low-latency make them a good fit for many applications of motion perception in the intelligent vehicle. However, as a younger and smaller research field compared to classical computer vision, neuromorphic vision is rarely connected with the intelligent vehicle. For this purpose, we present three novel datasets recorded with DAVIS sensors for the distracted driving research and focus on driver drowsiness detection,  driver gaze-zone recognition, and driver hand-gesture recognition. To unlock the potential of neuromorphic vision on the intelligent vehicle, we introduce three event-encoding methods to convert asynchronous event slices to event-frames and adapt state-of-the-art convolutional architectures to extensively evaluate their performances on the datasets. Together with qualitative and quantitative results, our approaches and datasets serve as a new and open-source benchmark named NeuroIV in the intelligent vehicle.
