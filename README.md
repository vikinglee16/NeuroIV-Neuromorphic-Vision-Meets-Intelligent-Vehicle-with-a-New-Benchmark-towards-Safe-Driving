## Abstract
Neuromorphic vision sensors such as the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) using silicon retina are inspired by biological vision, they generate streams of asynchronous events to indicate local log-intensity brightness changes. Their properties of high temporal resolution, low-bandwidth, lightweight computation, and low-latency make them a good fit for many applications of motion perception in the intelligent vehicle. However, as a younger and smaller research field compared to classical computer vision, neuromorphic vision is rarely connected with the intelligent vehicle. For this purpose, we release a novel dataset, *NeuroIV*, which comprises of three datasets recorded with DAVIS sensors and Depth camera.
